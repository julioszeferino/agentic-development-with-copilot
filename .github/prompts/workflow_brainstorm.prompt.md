# Brainstorm Command

> Collaborative exploration before requirements capture (Phase 0)

## Usage

Invoke this prompt from the Copilot Chat prompt picker (type `/` in chat and select `workflow_brainstorm`).

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Input argument | Uses the provided file, path, or text as context |
| No argument | Runs the full default workflow for this phase |

## Examples

```bash
# From a direct idea
/workflow_brainstorm "I want to automate invoice processing"

# From a file with notes
/workflow_brainstorm docs/meeting-notes.md

# From a problem statement
/workflow_brainstorm "Our team spends too much time on manual data entry"
```

## Overview

This is **Phase 0** of the 5-phase AgentSpec workflow:

```text
Phase 0: /workflow_brainstorm → .github/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md (THIS COMMAND)
Phase 1: /workflow_define     → .github/sdd/features/DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md
Phase 2: /workflow_design     → .github/sdd/features/DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md
Phase 3: /workflow_build      → Code + .github/sdd/reports/BUILD_REPORT_{FEATURE}.md
Phase 4: /workflow_ship       → .github/sdd/archive/{FEATURE}/SHIPPED_{DATE}.md
```

The `/workflow_brainstorm` command explores ideas through dialogue before capturing formal requirements.

## What This Command Does

1. **Explore** - Understand project context and existing patterns
2. **Question** - Ask one question at a time to clarify intent
3. **Collect** - Gather sample files, ground truth, or reference data for LLM grounding
4. **Propose** - Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
5. **Simplify** - Apply YAGNI to remove unnecessary features
6. **Validate** - Incrementally confirm understanding
7. **Document** - Generate BRAINSTORM document for /workflow_define

---

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

```markdown
read the file at .github/copilot-instructions.md
read the file at .github/sdd/templates/BRAINSTORM_TEMPLATE.md
Explore project structure, recent commits, existing patterns
```

### Step 2: Discovery Questions

Ask questions ONE AT A TIME:

| Question Type | When to Use |
|---------------|-------------|
| Multiple Choice | When options are clear (preferred) |
| Open-Ended | When exploring unknown territory |
| Clarifying | When answer was vague |

**Minimum:** 3 questions before proposing approaches

### Step 3: Sample Collection (LLM Grounding)

Ask about available samples to improve AI/LLM accuracy:

```markdown
"Do you have any samples that could help ground the solution?
(a) Sample input files
(b) Expected output examples
(c) Ground truth / verified data
(d) None available"
```

If samples exist, analyze and document them in the BRAINSTORM output.

### Step 4: Explore Approaches

Present 2-3 distinct approaches:

```markdown
### Approach A: {Name} ⭐ Recommended
**Why:** {Reasoning}
**Pros:** {Benefits}
**Cons:** {Trade-offs}

### Approach B: {Name}
**Why not recommended:** {Reasoning}
```

### Step 5: Apply YAGNI

For each feature, ask:
- Do we need this for MVP?
- Does this solve the core problem?

Remove features that don't pass. Document what was removed and why.

### Step 6: Validate Incrementally

Present design in sections (200-300 words each):

```text
Section → Check with user → Adjust if needed → Next section
```

**Minimum:** 2 validation checkpoints

### Step 7: Generate Document

```markdown
write to .github/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md
```

---

## Output

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **Brainstorm Document** | `.github/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md` |

**Next Step:** `/workflow_define .github/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md`

---

## Quality Gate

Before marking complete:

```text
[ ] Minimum 3 discovery questions asked
[ ] Sample collection question asked
[ ] At least 2 approaches explored
[ ] YAGNI applied (features removed)
[ ] Minimum 2 validations completed
[ ] User confirmed selected approach
[ ] Draft requirements included
```

---

## Interaction Style

### One Question at a Time

```markdown
GOOD:
"What's the primary use case?
(a) Internal reporting
(b) Customer-facing
(c) Both"

BAD:
"What's the use case? Who are the users? What's the timeline?"
```

### Lead with Recommendation

```markdown
GOOD:
"I recommend Approach A because [reasoning].
Here are the alternatives to consider..."

BAD:
"Here are three approaches. Which one do you want?"
```

### Be Ready to Go Back

```markdown
GOOD:
"That's different from what I understood. Let me revise..."

BAD:
"Moving on to the next section..."
```

## When to Use /workflow_brainstorm vs /workflow_define

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Vague idea, need to explore | `/workflow_brainstorm` |
| Clear requirements, ready to capture | `/workflow_define` directly |
| Existing BRAINSTORM document | `/workflow_define <brainstorm-file>` |
| Meeting notes with clear asks | `/workflow_define` directly |
| "I want to build something but not sure what" | `/workflow_brainstorm` |

---

## Tips

1. **Take your time** - Exploration is about understanding, not speed
2. **Ask why** - "Why do you need this?" reveals true requirements
3. **Challenge scope** - Most features aren't needed for MVP
4. **Trust the user** - They know their domain, you know patterns
5. **Document removed features** - They might come back later

---

## Handling Different Inputs

| Input Type | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| Vague idea | Start with "Tell me more about..." |
| Specific request | Validate understanding, then explore approaches |
| Problem statement | Focus on pain points, then solutions |
| Feature request | Question the need, explore alternatives |
| Comparison request | Explore trade-offs, make recommendation |
